# Scrapper Project

This repository contains a web scraping project. Here, we are using Python's virtual environment and Jupyter notebooks for development and testing.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed on your machine. We are using Python's built-in `venv` module to create virtual environments.

### Setting up a Python virtual environment

1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

2. Create a new virtual environment inside your project folder using the venv module:

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment named 'env'
python3 -m venv env

# Activate the virtual environment
source env/bin/activate

```

After running these commands, your terminal prompt should change to show the name of the activated environment. Now you can install dependencies isolated from your global Python environment. To deactivate the virtual environment, simply type `deactivate` in the terminal.
